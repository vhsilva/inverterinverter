Inverter flipper project

May 2016 - Project @ Tesla

This project began from an ergonomic issue in our drive inverter remanufacturing process. A technician hurt his arm when trying to flip a 13kg inverter. Because this required more care than 1st aid, it became an OSHA recordable.

This is where I step in. I was tasked to come up with a mechanical solution since an automated solution was far too expensive for this simple procedure. Thus, was born the tripole flipper, or as I like to call it, the inverter inverter.
