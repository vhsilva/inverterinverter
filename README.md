Inverter flipper project

May 2016 - Project @ Tesla

This project began from an ergonomic issue in our drive inverter remanufacturing process. A technician hurt his arm when trying to flip a 13kg inverter. Because this required more care than 1st aid, it became an OSHA recordable.

This is where I step in. I was tasked to come up with a mechanical solution since an automated solution was far too expensive for this simple procedure. Thus, was born the tripole flipper, or as I like to call it, the inverter inverter. 

This design is completely mechanical. No pneumatic or electric actuators whatsover. I completely removed the need for actuators by creating a 'cradle' of sorts for the inverter and its respective stands. This cradle clamps the inverter in z-direction. Side supports allow the user to rotate the inverter 180 degrees without risk of it falling. Graphite impregnated brass bushings were employed for easy, low-friction rotation. Fitted with damper to control rate of rotation.

Total costs savings of this project were over $30k.
